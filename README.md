# tensor completion on alpha rank

Tensor completion to achieve more efficient strategy comparisons for evaluation methods like alpha-rank, inspired by the work [Estimating â†µ-Rank from A Few Entries with Low Rank Matrix Completion](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/du21e/du21e.pdf) from yali du.

To start
```
python3 tensorCompletionWithAlphaRank/testLowRank.py
```
